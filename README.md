# Retinal-Blood-Vessel-Segmentation
##### Retinal is a layer in the eye that containsmillions of nerve cells or photoreceptrons that react to light. Thesephotoreceptors send impulses to the optic nerveand changed to be  the image that we can see . Most humans do not care about eyes health conditions especially the retinal, until there is a disturbance in the eye that can cause blindness. Retinal disease is a visual disorder that makesa bad effect of human vision, such as blindness and low vision. The number of this disease always increasing every year. Based on the World Health Organization fact sheet 2014, there are 285 million people in the world have a visual  impairment,  39  million  of  this  number  have  blind  and  246  have  low  vision .  Visual impairment can be prevented by early detection of retinal disease.
##### Here I have proposed my own way to segment Image and extract vessels. at last calculate Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy for Images in DRIVE DataBase.
